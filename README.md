# NYTLYF is a night life tracking app for android that tells you what is going on in your area and lets you track where you've been.

It will find bars, clubs, or restaurants in your vicinity and show descriptions for them, as well as let you call a Lyft or Uber right from the app.  

It is meant to cut down on screen time for people who would rather be enjoying their nights out on the town.
